# Lifecycle of Elements

Running Evergine components, entities, or other objects executes a number of functions in a predetermined order. This document describes those functions and explains how they fit into the execution sequence.

The following elements have the same lifecycle methods, and all information described in this document can be applied to each one:

* [Components](component_arch/components/index.md)
* [Entities](component_arch/entities/index.md)
* [Services](services.md)
* [SceneManagers](scenes/scenemanagers.md)

## Lifecycle Overview

The diagram below summarizes how Evergine orders and repeats function invocations over the element's lifetime:

## Lifecycle Properties

All elements that implement the default lifecycle share the same properties. These properties and methods are exposed in the `AttachableObject` class. Because of this, the Component, Entity, Service, or SceneServices classes extend the AttachableObject class.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **IsEnabled** (getter and setter) | Allows enabling or disabling an element. A disabled Behavior is not updated, or a disabled Drawable does not draw anything. |
| **State** (getter) | Gets the current state of this object. We cover this area later in this document. | 

To easily check states, Evergine offers several properties (getter only) to determine the state of the element:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **IsLoaded** | Indicates if this object has been **loaded** (the OnLoaded() method has been invoked). |
| **IsAttached** | Indicates if this object has been **attached** (the OnAttached() method has been invoked). When an element is detached, this property is set to `false`. |
| **IsActivated** | Indicates if this object has been **activated** (the OnActivated() method has been invoked). |
| **IsStarted** | Indicates if this object has been **started** (the Start() method has been invoked). |
| **IsDestroyed** | Indicates if this object has been **destroyed** (the OnDestroy() method has been invoked). |

## Initialization

These methods are usually called when the Application starts.

### OnLoaded()

This method is called after the element is deserialized (during the scene loading) or created from code:

* This method is invoked **once** during the object’s lifetime.
* OnLoaded() is usually used to initialize all variables and functionality that **do not depend on other external elements**.

> [!NOTE]
> At this step, all bindings are not yet resolved.

### OnAttached()

This method is invoked when an element is attached to Evergine. 

* **All bindings are resolved** prior to the execution of this method.
* This method is used to establish dependencies with external elements.
* This method returns a boolean value. Return `true` if the execution has succeeded, otherwise the component is not successfully attached.

> [!NOTE]
> At this step, all binding elements (Components, for example) may not have been attached yet.

### OnActivated()

This method is invoked when an element is activated. This can happen after the OnAttached() execution or when we change the IsEnabled property.

* This method is only invoked if `IsEnabled == true`. If a Component **or** its Entity has been disabled, this method is not executed.
* During this method, we set up the functionality once we have previously established all dependencies. Usually, we put here all code that can be easily undone when the component will be deactivated (subscribe to events, for example).

> [!NOTE]
> At this step, all dependencies (Components, for example) have been previously attached, but some elements may not have been activated yet.

### Start()

This method is called **before the first frame update** only if the element has been previously activated.

* This method is called only **once** per attachment. If we enable or disable a Component, the Start method is not called again. However, if we detach a Component and reattach it to an Entity, the Start() method will be called again (after the OnAttached() and OnActivated() invocations).
* In this method, we usually put all initialization functionality that depends on other elements and that we only want to execute once.

> [!NOTE]
> At this step, all dependencies have been activated, but some elements may not have been started yet. 

## Per Frame Loop

During the application Update/Draw loop, each frame the following methods are invoked:

### Update()

This method is only available on [Behaviors](component_arch/components/behaviours.md), [UpdatableServices](services.md), or [UpdatableSceneManagers](scenes/scenemanagers.md). 

* This method can only be executed if the element has been started (attached and initialized).
* In general terms, the Update() method is called once per frame.
* We put here execution code to update the application logic or state (player movement, camera input controller, etc.).

### Draw()

This method is only available on [Drawables](component_arch/components/drawables.md).

* This method can only be executed if the element has been started (attached and initialized).
* The Draw() method is called **once per drawing camera**, during the rendering phase.
* We put here all code to update RenderObjects before the camera processes them.
 
## Deinitialization

Evergine follows the following steps to properly destroy or detach an element.

### OnDeactivated()

This method is called when an activated element becomes disabled or inactive.

* This method is the opposite of the OnActivated() method, and it's a good practice to undo all functionalities done in the OnActivated() method (unsubscribe events, for example).

### OnDetach()

OnDetach is called when an element is detached.

* This method is the opposite of the OnAttached() method, and it's a good practice to undo all functionalities done in the OnAttached() method.

### OnDestroy()

This method is invoked when the element is definitively removed and we want to destroy or dispose of objects.

* A destroyed element cannot be attached again, and it is finally disposed of.
* A good practice is to remove all internal data of this component (tables, collections, etc.).
